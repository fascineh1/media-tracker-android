# Week 11 Reflection — Bonus Feature Sprint (Week 1 of 2)

*This week's reflection is different from the standard template. We're not doing Profile this week — instead, this is the first of two weeks building your assigned bonus feature (Write Review, Quotes, or Priorities). See `reflection-instructions.md` for naming/submission rules, which are unchanged; only the content below differs.*

## Code Review

<!-- Code review continues as normal — same pod rotation, regardless of which bonus feature you or your pod mate are building. -->

**Reviewed:** *Issa Ali*
**Link to my review:*https://github.com/Issa-Ismail-Ali/media-tracker-android/commit/ab945e17d52adb4ce0f4fa93baa92cf76c08f21d#r195295347*

### What I Looked At
--> I reviewed Issa Ali's implementation of the Quotes bonus feature. 
I focused on how the networking layer was wired to the backend, how the repository handled API calls, 
and how the new feature fit into the existing project architecture.

### What I Noticed
--> The implementation follows the existing project architecture well. 
I noticed that Issa created separate model and request classes (Quote.kt and AddQuoteRequest.kt) instead of placing everything into one file, which keeps the code organized.

I also noticed that the repository includes dedicated functions such as addQuote() and getQuotes(), along with error handling that parses API responses before returning meaningful error messages. 
This makes the networking layer easier to maintain and debug.

### Comments I Left
--> I commented on Issa's separation of the Quotes networking code into dedicated models, request classes, and repository functions. I noted that keeping API operations such as addQuote() and getQuotes() in the repository instead of the UI helps maintain separation of concerns and makes the feature easier to test and maintain. 
I also commented on the repository's API error handling because parsing the backend error response into a meaningful message makes failures easier to debug and gives the UI more useful information to display.

## Bonus Feature Progress

<!-- This is the most important section this week. Be concrete: which endpoint(s) did you wire?
     What's actually showing on screen with real data? What's still stubbed or fake?
     "I worked on my bonus feature" is not an answer. "I got POST /quotes working from Media Detail
     and quotes show up in a list on my profile, but I haven't wired edit or delete yet" is. -->

**What's working:**
--> What's working:
-Implemented the Priorities feature using the real backend API.
-Connected the GET /priorities endpoint to load existing priorities.
-Connected the PUT /priorities endpoint to save priority changes.
-Added the Priorities section to the Library screen.
-Added the Set Priority dialog.
-Users can:
     Add items to priorities.
     Edit priority level (High, Medium, Low).
     Save estimated hours.
     Save notes.
     Remove priorities.
-Priority cards display:
     Priority level
     Estimated time
     Notes
-Priority count updates correctly (for example, 3/5).
-Fixed crashes caused by duplicate L
azyColumn keys.
-Fixed missing mediaId request errors by correcting the request mapping.
-Added unit tests for the Priorities ViewModel.

**What's still stubbed, fake, or not started:**
-Drag-and-drop reordering still needs additional testing and polishing.
-More validation is needed for edge cases when editing priorities.
-Additional UI polish is planned for Week 2.

**What I'm blocked on, if anything:**
--> I am not currently blocked. Earlier in development I encountered API request errors ("Missing required field: mediaId"), duplicate key crashes in Compose, and issues saving priorities. 
After debugging the request objects and repository logic, those issues were resolved.

## One Thing I Understood More Deeply

--> This week helped me understand more deeply how data moves through the different layers of an Android MVVM application. 
For the Priorities feature, the Compose UI sends user actions to PrioritiesViewModel, the ViewModel updates its UI state and calls the repository, and the repository communicates with the backend through the Retrofit GET /priorities and PUT /priorities endpoints. Debugging the missing mediaId request also helped me see how an incorrect request model or mapping can cause a feature that looks correct in the UI to fail at the API layer. 
Tracing that problem from the server response back through the repository and ViewModel made the relationship between these layers much clearer to me.

## One Thing I'm Still Confused About

-->  I would like to better understand the best practices for implementing drag-and-drop reordering in Jetpack Compose while keeping the UI synchronized with the backend order indexes. 
I also want to learn more about handling optimistic updates when network requests fail.

---

## Anything Else *(optional)*

--> This project required significantly more debugging than previous assignments because it involved integrating new API endpoints with existing Library functionality. 
Although I encountered several crashes and API errors during development, working through them helped me gain confidence debugging Compose UI, Retrofit requests, and ViewModel state management.

## Rubric

*You don't need to self-assess — this is here so you know what I'm looking at.*

| Section | Points | Full Credit | Half Credit | No Credit |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **Reflection** | 10 | Concrete progress report (what's wired, what's not) plus specific, honest "Understood More Deeply" and "Still Confused" sections. | Present but vague — "I worked on my feature" with no specifics on what's actually working. | Missing or one-word answers. |
| **Code Review** | 10 | Specific observation about the code with explanation of why it matters (or a substantive positive comment). Link to review present and verified. | A question or comment that shows you read the code, but lacks explanation. | "Looks good!" or equivalent. Missing link. Review not found on GitHub. |
| **Total** | **20** | | | |

**A note on the code review score:** I check that the review actually exists on GitHub before grading. The written summary here and the GitHub comment should match.
